# Image Denoising Project

This repository contains CCDDNet, a deep learning-based model for bit-plane specific image denoising. It trains and denoises each RGB component separately using TensorFlow and OpenCV. All dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ train.ipynb       # Jupyter notebook for training the denoising model
â”œâ”€â”€ testing.py        # Python script for testing the trained model
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt  # List of required packages

````

## ðŸ”§ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aaru5246/CCDDNET.git
cd your-repo-name
````

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate          # On Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

### ðŸ”§ Training

Open the `train.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially to train your denoising model.

### ðŸ§ª Testing

Run the `test.py` script to test the model on new images:

```bash
python test.py
```

Modify `test.py` if needed to change input/output paths or model parameters.

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

* `numpy`
* `tensorflow`
* `opencv-python`

These are listed in `requirements.txt` for easy installation.
